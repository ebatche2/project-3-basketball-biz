# Background
The average NBA team is worth $1.9 billion, up 13% over last year.
Player salary contracts for the 2023-2024 season ranges from over $1 Million for the lowest paid paid player, to over $50 Million for the highest paid player, Stephen Curry
Millions of fans around the world place heavy focus on individual players and games, but have you ever thought about how the NBA works as a business?
Team owners must consider the various forms of income and debt
We decided to collect data that a team owner would potentially consider when building their team and display this on a webpage


# Web Page Goals
Help team owners build the most profitable team based on player stats, salaries, stadium costs, debt and operating income
Create a visual map for team owners to see stadium locations and facts



# Steps 
**Find & Prepare Data**
We used Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/logandonaldson/sports-stadium-locations) and Web scraping (https://www.forbes.com/nba-valuations/list/#tab:overall) and (https://geoshen.com/posts/nba-arenas-ranked-by-seating-capacity)  to find data on:
- team value, debt, revenue, operating income, Team rankings & Statistics, Stadium info, Stadium Costs, Costs per Seat and more
- Then we cleaned up the Data & created 5 tables in DB Browser for SQLite

_Challenges:_
When web scraping one page, had to add “sleep” and “scroll” code to be able to scrape everything from the page (dynamically loaded JS content)
Unable to get data from SQLite to feed into webpage



**Folders, Folders and more Folders**
Created all necessary Folders

_Challenges:_
Had difficulty tying together the routes



**Plotly Charts**
Was able to create a chart using data entered directly into VS Code.

_Challenges:_
Had difficulty creating charts w/ Databases from SQLite




**Putting it all Together**
Final webpage 




# Conclusion

In conclusion this project proved to have several challenging points, demonstrating the work and skills that it takes to create an interactive webpage. 
Once the page is complete, a Team owner could ideally look at the different teams and consider various points that contribute to overall revenue
Then use this data to make informed decisions 

_Lessons Learned:_
Start off with building the most basic page and focus on getting the routes to tie into each other first. 
The NBA is an extremely lucrative business!
